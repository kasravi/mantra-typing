### Objective 
I was trying to learn touch typing (on [keybr](keybr.com)) when I realized words' meanings (or better to say emotions tied with their meaning) are implicitly transferring to my unconscious mind. Not that big a deal TBH but it felt different to repeat the word "useless" 100s of times in the morning to some extent. Proximity of what I was feeling to concepts like [Mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra) felt like I could do at least a quick experiment.

So I made yet another typing tutor focused on the word sentiments.

I used the Circumplex model of emotion and got the word sentiments from [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-012-0314-x) paper. I found the CSV file for the data [here](https://github.com/JULIELab/XANEW/tree/master). 
> I did not include the Dominance factor, mosltly because I didn't want to spend time on making a 3d space selector :) and that I cared mostly about Valence and Arousal.

### Further Details
1. This is not a product to use, maybe just an experiment. I didn't put any effort into capturing progress or planning lessons.
2. Because of the experimental nature of it, I also tried more stuff. like 
    - instead of showing a keyboard as a guide/help, I show the finger movements. If the objective of learning touch typing is to train muscle memories, why not aim exactly for that?
    - instead of a long list of words, I just show one word. I think one word at a time(?) so maybe aim for that.

got the english corpus from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
